    <p>
        <br> I was born in Ukraine in New Year's Eve in 1990 and I
        <br> Believe since that time I was dreaming to create some magic.
        <br> I moved to USA in 2014 having a Master's degree in
        <br> Management and some QA Analyst experience.
        <br>
        <br> Being a QA was a great time of my life and my attention
        <br> To details and curious mind helped my to be really good at what I was doing.
        <br> Currently I have more than 4 years of QA experience and I feel
        <br> That I'm ready to move on.
        <br>
        <br> My creativity pushed me to be interested in design and creating
        <br> Stuff but I didn't want to leave technical area so I feel that
        <br> Front-end is something I love and can be good at even more than
        <br> Testing. I tried different languages but JavaScript is a real
        <br> Magic I was born with and after I started digging into it I
        <br> Realized - this is it. That's what I wanna do for the next 4+ years.
