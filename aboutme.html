            <br>
            <br> I was born in Ukraine in New Year's Eve in 1990 and I
            <br> Believe since that time I was dreaming to create some magic.
            <br> I moved to USA in 2014 having a Master's degree in
            <br> Management and some QA Analyst experience.
            <br>
            <br> Attention to details and curious mind helped me being really
            <br> good at what I was doing. I have more than 4 years of
            <br> experience in Quality Assurance and currently I’m developing
            <br> myself as an Automation QA Engineer. I love coding but I love
            <br> QA too much to move to development. Combination of those
            <br> desires makes me a perfect Automation who wants to develop
            <br> skills and cover all possible routine in testing life cycle.
            <br> Currently I’m working on coverage for React Native applications
            <br> for Android and iOS using JavaScript and React.
