                I was born in Ukraine in New Year's Eve in 1990 and I believe since that time I was dreaming to create some magic.
                <br> 
                <br>
                I moved to USA in 2014 having a Master's degree in Management and some QA Analyst experience.
                <br>
                <br>
                Attention to details and curious mind helped me being really good at what I was doing. I have more than 6 years of
                experience in Quality Assurance and currently I’m developing myself as an Automation QA Engineer. I love coding but I love
                QA too much to move to development. Combination of those desires makes me a perfect Automation who wants to develop
                skills and cover all possible routine in testing life cycle.
                <br> 
                <br>
                Currently I’m working on coverage for React Native applications for Android and iOS using JavaScript and React.
